Example datapack.
Adds spawns for custom variants of Swamp Wyvern and River Pikehorn.

Swamp Wyvern:
- Barren Orange and Barren Brown - can be found in badlands, orange spawns below Y 80, brown - above Y 80
- Ender - spawns (drum roll) in the End

River Pikehorn:
- Striped - can be found anywhere where pikehorns can spawn

River Pikehorn's Striped variant shows the simplest way of adding variant to the pool alongside existing ones.
Swamp Wyvern's variants show how to add variants with conditions to spawn.
In order to allow new Swamp Wyvern's variant to spawn #uselessreptile:wyvern_spawnable_on block tag and #uselessreptile:swamp_wyvern_spawn_whitelist biome tag had to be edited to include end and badlands blocks and respective biomes.
Pack also edits default variant spawns for Swamp Wyvern in order to prevent default variants spawning in the same biomes as added variants.
