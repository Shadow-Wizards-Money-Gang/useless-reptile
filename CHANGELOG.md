- Fixed crash when either Lightning Chaser or Swamp Wyvern tried to shoot

### Known Issues:
- Glowing layer doesn't display with shaders turned on
- When Lightning Chaser has surrendered, it takes 2 clicks to actually claim it
- Dragon rotations in some scenarios may be very out of sync with the server
